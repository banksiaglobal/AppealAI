                The AppealAI project is a fascinating case study on integrating modern AI technologies, specifically
                vector search and generative AI, with InterSystems technologies to create practical and impactful
                solutions. It's a sample application designed to automate the process of writing
                appeals against insurance denials for medical procedures. Leveraging advanced AI technologies, it
                assists users by generating tailored appeal letters based on specific case details entered
                by the user.
                The app utilizes a database of documents related to each specific insurance product to enhance the
                effectiveness of each generated appeal. Hereâ€™s an overview of how these components work together in
                the AppealAI application:

            <h2>Understanding the Components</h2>
            <div class="section">

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Vector Search:</b> This technology allows the system to search through large amounts of data
                        by converting text into vectors (arrays of numbers) that represent the text in a
                        multi-dimensional space. By using algorithms like cosine similarity, the system can quickly find
                        the most relevant texts based on vector closeness.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <b>Generative AI:</b>
                        This involves AI models that can generate text based on input data. In the case of
                        AppealAI, generative AI helps draft personalized appeal letters by understanding the context and
                        specifics of each case, such as the medical procedure involved and the details of the insurance
                        denial. We are using approach called
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</b>
                        It's a model architecture that combines previous two components of artificial intelligence by
                        using vector search to find documents or information that are relevant to the input query,
                        incorporating it into the AI prompt, and using Generative AI to generate a template of an appeal
                        letter
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        <b>Setup: </b>First, we use InterSystems IRIS to manage and store all the available data about
                        insurance products, such as insurance contracts, policy limits, exclusions, etc. System will
                        convert documents to
                        text, split them into small chunks, and convert those chunks into vectors. This data
                        serves as the foundation for querying during operations.

                    </li>

                    <b> Run: </b>Users input letters with specific details about the insurance denial, such as the
                    procedure
                    code, reason for denial, and patient information. The system uses vector search to quickly sift
                    through data uploaded on the previous step.
                    Then, using generative AI, the system drafts a customized appeal letter.
